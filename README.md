# Xinference Client

The Xinference Client is a lightweight client for the Xinference service. It provides an interface to interact with the Xinference service without requiring the installation of the entire Xinference package. This is particularly useful when using the `XinferenceEmbedding` feature within Langchain, as it avoids the need to install large packages such as PyTorch, which can be burdensome when packaging Python applications into executable files.

## Features

- Lightweight client for the Xinference service.
- Allows interaction with the Xinference service without the need for the full Xinference package.
- Supports the `XinferenceEmbedding` feature within Langchain.
